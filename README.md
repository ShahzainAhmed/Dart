## Final and Const Keywords
If you never want to change a value, then use final and const keywords.
* final varName = "Shahzain";
* const PI = 3.14;

### final keyword:
- A variable with the final keyword will be initialized at runtime, and can only be assigned for a single time.
- You can define a final variable in a class or function.

### const keyword:
- A variable with the const keyword is initialized at compile time, and is already assigned when at runtime. 
- You cannot define a const inside a class. But you can define it in a function.
